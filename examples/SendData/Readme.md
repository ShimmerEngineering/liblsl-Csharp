This has been updated just to test the feasibility of using the Shimmer API. Test looks promising, but no validation was done.

Steps to run the example
1. include lsl.dll into the liblsl project's root directory
2. right click lsl.dll file, select properties, update build action to content, copy to output directory to copy if newer
3. Run SendData to create a stream outlet and make the streaming data available for other platforms
4. Run ReceiveData to retrieve the streaming data
